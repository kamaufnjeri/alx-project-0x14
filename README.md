## API overview

The MovieDatabaseApi provides data on movies, tv series and actors. It provides various endpoints to access movies details, tv shows data, actors profilles and images. It is useful for developers seeking to integrate the api with their apps to provide this information to clients in the apps.


## Version

Version 3


## Available Endpoints

- **Movies**: Retrieve detailed information about movies, including credits, reviews, and recommendations.
- **TV Shows**: Access data on TV series, including episodes, seasons, and cast information.
- **People**: Obtain profiles of actors, directors, and other industry professionals.
- **Genres**: Explore available genres for movies and TV shows.
- **Search**: Perform searches across movies, TV shows, and people.
- **Configuration**: Access configuration data such as image sizes and available languages.


## Request and Response Format

## Request and Response Format

### Request Format

To fetch movie details, send a **GET** request to:

```http
GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY```

For searching movies by query:

```http
GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=fight&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY```

### Response Format
The response is a JSON object. Hereâ€™s an example of a successful response for movie details:

```
{
  "id": 550,
  "title": "Fight Club",
  "overview": "A ticking-time-bomb insomniac channels primal male aggression...",
  "release_date": "1999-10-15",
  "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}],
  "vote_average": 8.438
}
```

The response includes key details like:

```id, title, overview, release_date, genres, and vote_average.
```
For search results, the response contains:


```{
  "page": 1,
  "results": [
    {"id": 550, "title": "Fight Club", "release_date": "1999-10-15"}
  ]
}```

Error Responses
Errors return a JSON object with status_code and status_message. Example for unauthorized access:


```{
  "status_code": 7,
  "status_message": "Invalid API key."
}```

### Best Practices
Always check the response status code to handle success and errors.
Use pagination for search results to manage large datasets.


## Authentication

To authenticate your requests to the TMDb API, you need an API key. Here's how to authenticate your requests:

1. **Obtain Your API Key**:
   - Log in to your [TMDb account](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - Click profile picture choose settings.
   - Navigate to your **Account Settings**.
   - In the settings, go to the **API** section.
   - You can now access the API Key under API key section.

2. **Include API Key in Requests**:
   You can authenticate your requests in two ways:

   **Option 1: Bearer Token**
   - Add the API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your request.

   Example:
   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

### Option 2: API Key in URL

You can also include the API key directly in the request URL.

Example:

```http
GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY```

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual key you generated

## Error Handling

When interacting with the TMDb API, it's essential to handle potential errors gracefully. Below are common error responses and recommended handling strategies:

### Common Error Responses

- **401 Unauthorized**: Occurs when the API key is invalid or missing.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The service is temporarily unavailable; try again later.

### Handling Errors in Your Code

1. **Check Response Status Codes**: Always inspect the HTTP status code of the API response.

2. **Implement Retry Logic**: For transient errors like 503, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

3. **Log Errors**: Maintain logs of errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

4. **Provide User Feedback**: Inform users of issues with appropriate messages.

5. **Handle Specific Errors**: For example, if a 404 error occurs, inform the user that the requested resource was not found.


## Usage Limits and Best Practices

When integrating with The Movie Database (TMDb) API, it's essential to understand its usage policies and adhere to best practices to ensure efficient and responsible use.

### Usage Limits

TMDb enforces rate limiting to maintain service stability and prevent abuse. As of December 16, 2019, the original rate limit of 40 requests every 10 seconds was disabled. However, a base level of rate limiting is still enforced by one of TMDb's CDN providers to help prevent DDoS attacks. This includes a maximum of 50 requests per second and 20 connections per IP. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Best Practices

1. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Request only the data you need to minimize unnecessary API calls.

2. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data, reducing the number of API requests and improving application performance.

3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors by checking response status codes and implementing retry logic for transient errors.

4. **Attribution**: If you use TMDb's data or images, ensure proper attribution as required by their terms of service. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

5. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor your application's API usage to stay within acceptable limits and avoid potential service disruptions.
